**Problem:**
Given an integer array `nums`, rotate the array to the right by `k` steps, where `k` is non-negative.

**Example:**


Input: nums = \[1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
Output: \[5,6,7,1,2,3,4]



Approach:
1. Normalize `k` so that itâ€™s within the length of the array: `k = k % len(nums)`.
2. Use slicing:
   - Last k elements move to the front.
   - The rest follow.
3. This runs in O(n) time and O(n) space (or can be optimized for O(1) space with in-place reversal).
