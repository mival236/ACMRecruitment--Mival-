1. **Iterative Method**
   - Use a loop to build the reversed string character by character.
   - Works without using built-in reverse functions.

2. **Recursive Method**
   - Base case: if the string is empty or length 1, return it.
   - Recursive case: reverse the substring from the second character onward, then append the first character.
